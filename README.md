# Emagi Front-End - Part 3



Welcome back! At the end of Part 2, we:

1. got `encodeWord` in tip-top form, handling all kinds of weird input to give a good answer to the user's request, and
2. put a framework in place to allow the user to pick which command including translation and encoding, but with the ability to extend to any future commands we implement.

That implementation starts now! In Part 3, we're going to add:

1. MadLibs - asking for random emojis by category in the middle of our sentences.
2. Search - find an emoji by name.
3. Random - get a random emoji, filtered by category if desired.


Welcome to part 3, the final part. Let's master these emagi!
